# Concurrent Traffic Simulation

### Introduction:

A multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository using command `git clone https://github.com/SatishDivvi/Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation.git`.
2. Create a **build** folder and then cd into the folder using `mkdir build && cd build`.
3. Run command `cmake .. && make`.

**Note:** _For **Step-3** to successfully execute make sure you are in **GPU Mode**._ 

### Project Execution:

1. Execute command `./traffic_simulation`.
2. Traffic Simulator should now be running.
